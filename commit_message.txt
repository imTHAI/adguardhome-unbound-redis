feat: Improve startup robustness and enable recursive DNSSEC by default

This commit implements major structural changes in the entrypoint script and Dockerfile
to ensure reliable startup and secure DNSSEC validation across all environments.

Key changes:

1. **Startup Reliability (DNSSEC Anchor Fix):**

   * Added an 'unbound-anchor retry loop' in 'entrypoint.sh' to bypass the network race condition that caused the first startup to fail ('set -e').

   * Corrected 'unbound-anchor' syntax to use a temporary 'resolv.conf' file, ensuring compatibility with the 'sh' shell.

2. **Security and Permissions (DNSSEC Write Access):**

   * The 'root.key' file is moved from '/config/unbound' (persistent volume owned by root) to an internal container directory, '/etc/unbound/var', owned by the 'unbound' user.

   * This resolves the critical permissions conflict ('Permission denied') that prevented Unbound from updating the trust anchor (necessary for KSK Rollover) after dropping 'root' privileges.

   * 'netcat-openbsd' was added to the Dockerfile to allow for service readiness checks.

3. **Configuration Management (Existing Users):**

   * The copying logic in 'entrypoint.sh' has been revised to use a robust method: copy everything for new users, but explicitly add only **new configuration files** ('dnssec.conf') for existing users.

   * This ensures that advanced users who intentionally delete files (like 'forward-queries.conf' to switch to recursive mode) do not have their modifications overwritten during container updates.
